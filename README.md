# React-Native-Blog
## This was a final project for my React Native class. I got experience using Expo for development and incorporating Firebase for authentification and database services.

The assignment required me to make a website with React Native using Expo and it had to include navigation routing, authentification, be able to create and save data using Firebase and have a screen that lists data from the Firebase database.

I made a blog site that stores each blog entry in the Firebase database:

Each blog entry was styled to look like a polaroid picture:

There was an admin login page using Firebase Authentification:

After logging in the user could fill out a form to add a new blog entry:

And a form to create new users:
